Before you begin
----------------

1. Clone `https://github.com/oracle/docker-images`.
1. Download the Oracle Database 19c binary `LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip` from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html
1. Put the zip in the `OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0` directory. **Do not unzip it.**
1. In Docker Desktop, ensure you have a large enough amount of memory allocated. These instructions will set the total memory to 4000MB, so make sure Docker has a value higher than that. Remove unwanted or unused images. User `docker image prune` to remove old unused images.

Building
--------


````
cd OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles
./buildContainerImage.sh -v 19.3.0 -e
````

Running the docker image
-------

To use the sensible defaults:

```
docker run \
--name oracle19c \
-p 1521:1521 \
-p 5500:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PDB=orcl \
-e ORACLE_PWD=password \
-e INIT_SGA_SIZE=3000 \
-e INIT_PGA_SIZE=1000 \
-v /opt/oracle/oradata \
-d \
oracle/database:19.3.0-ee

```
On first run, the database will be created and setup for you. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Open Docker Dashboard and watch the progress. Then you can connect.

Executing shell commands on this container
-------

First get hold of the docker container id by running the following command
```
docker ps | grep oracle19c
```
Then execute the following commands (using the container id from the above command) to enter the shell and to connect to the Database.
```
docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
bash-4.2$ sqlplus sys/password@//localhost:1521/orcl as sysdba
```

You should now be connected to the Oracle Database. You can now create a user using the following command. This is the username and password that you configure in your Springboot app (in the application.properties file).

```
SQL> CREATE USER SPRINGORCL IDENTIFIED BY springorclpwd;
```
After the user is created, grant privelages to it using the following command

```
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO SPRINGORCL;
```
And then connect to the Database using the user with the following command.

```
SQL> CONNECT SPRINGORCL@orcl;
```
Create the table that your Springboot app needs to connect to.

```
CREATE TABLE Person (
  id INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
   first_name VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
   last_name VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
   birth_date date NOT NULL,
   CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
